# Book-Cafe-App
Python/JSON web app from AWS Bootcamp final project (book cafe app), I altered and re-coded the app 
so customers details are stored and retrieved from multiple JSON files, added book cafe logo and 
enhanced app performance with concise coding.

Updates: Minor alterations to the app
